Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by [Dr. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/). I develop methods to understand complex networks and systems, especially the diffusion of information on social media platforms. I combine machine learning, data science, and network science techniques to gain insight from large-scale human behavior data. The goal is to *produce actionable insights for a better online world* ðŸŒŸâœ¨

At the [Observatory on Social Media](href='https://osome.iu.edu/), I work on social media moderation. This includes developing methods to detect online misinformation, abuse and bad actors, modeling the impacts of deterrence strategies, and designing *prosocial* recommendation algorithms.
