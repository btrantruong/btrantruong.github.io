Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by [Dr. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/). I develop computational methods to understand human behavior and information dynamics from large-scale data. I combine techniques such as data science, social network analysis, and natural language processing. The goal is to *produce actionable insights for a better online world* ðŸŒŸâœ¨

At the [Observatory on Social Media](href='https://osome.iu.edu/), I work on ways to combat online (mis)information. My research spans from detecting inauthentic actors to developing computational models to measure the impact of social media abuse and propose moderation policies. Beyond that, I envision a revamped online governance that highlights the role of social norms in creating a more trustworthy digital landscape.
