The [Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)](https://humancompatible.ai/) at UC Berkeley is conducting a large-scale, multi-platform field experiment to assess solutions promoting prosocial behavior on social media, called [The Prosocial Ranking Challenge (PRC)](https://humancompatible.ai/news/2024/01/18/the-prosocial-ranking-challenge-60000-in-prizes-for-better-social-media-algorithms/). 

Our ranker was chosen as a [finalist](https://rankingchallenge.substack.com/p/announcing-the-finalists-of-the-prosocial)! We aim to create a [‚Äúbridging‚Äù algorithm](https://bridging.systems/) that enhances mutual understanding and trust in social media interactions. It prioritizes posts that evoke civil discussions while appealing to an [ideologically diverse audience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01276-5). 

The awesome team: Saumya Bhadani, [Ozgur Seckin](https://www.ozgurcanseckin.com/) and Do Won Kim. 

I‚Äôm thrilled to be a part of PRC and working alongside all these outstanding researchers (crowd science rocks!). Revving up for the busy & exciting months ahead.. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è
